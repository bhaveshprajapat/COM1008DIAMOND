            <p>This £81 million project, opening its doors in 2015 as the new Faculty of Engineering building, is the highlight for the University of Sheffield and has been quoted as a unique and inspiring facility that won the design through innovation award in the 2016 Yorkshire and Humber Region Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors award. In this guide we hope to show you what it is like to study in the Diamond and to showcase the numerous facilites that the Diamond has to offer you during your first year as a Computer Science Undergraduate at the University of Sheffield.</p>
