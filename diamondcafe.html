            <p>The Diamond Café is conveniently located to allow you to grab food on the go. Located just to the left of the main reception on the ground floor, there are a number of spaces to sit and eat with a few friends.</p>

            <p>There's a small island situated at the centre of the Café, where you can order from a range of hot drinks, such as a hot chocolate or a mocha. You can also order smoothies and choose from a range of snacks such as biscuits, cakes and bars. TAt Christmas time, you can also find a festive drinks range!</p>

            <p>The Diamond Kitchen is located opposite the Island, where you can order from a small range of freshly prepared meals, every day of the week. There is a wide variety in the meals offered each day, from Jacket Potatoes to Sri Lankan Chicken Curry. We’d personally recommend the Diamond Wrap, which will always go down a treat, or the Butterfly Chicken Breast Burger; pictured to the right (or at the top of the page on mobile devices)</p>

            <p>If you don’t fancy any of the meals on offer, there’s also a very large variety of sandwiches, drinks and snacks on offer too. All in typical meal-deal fashion. There are classic sandwiches like a BLT or Chicken Sandwich, and there's some original combinations too. We'd highly recommend taking a few moments to see what's on offer.</p>
