            <p>The Diamond also features an <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/diamond/engineering/iforge">IForge</a> which is a student run prototyping lab where they can prototype anything they can dream of. Having 3D printers, laser cutters, woodworking tools and an electronics station where students can make anything they want; Gaining them valuable skills and realising their creativity.</p>

            <p>On top of this there is also a Clean Room that provides a unique environment for students to study microfabrication techniques, the room being <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/diamond/engineering/cleanroom"> one hundred times </a> cleaner than outside air allowing students to create and test devices smaller than a living cell without contamination.</p>

            <p>Diamond features four large computer labs, which have a total of over 400 computers available for students to use. One of the largest labs has a purpose-built robot arena, that is used to test NAO humanoid robots and Lego Mindstorm blocks.</p>

            <p>There is also a Virtual and Augment Reality suite featuring 9 workstations and a large 5x2.6m in size VR screens with active dual 4k wall and floor projection. There are also 8 camera active infrared tracking system allows students to motion capture up to 50 targets as well as finger tracking.</p>
